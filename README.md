# structures
A collection of c++ data structures I've coded up for various projects. This is intended as a complement for the STL, not a replacement. All of the included structures are a bit too exotic/niche to have made it into the STL.

Contents currently include:
- Suffix tree
- Union find variant with some added functionality
- Min-max heap
